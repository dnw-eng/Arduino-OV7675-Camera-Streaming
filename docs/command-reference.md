- Streaming status reflects current state

## üìñ **Command Best Practices**

### **For New Users:**
1. **Start with 'c'** to test basic functionality
2. **Use '?' frequently** to check system status
3. **Try 'p' and 'x'** to test streaming control

### **For Troubleshooting:**
1. **Use 't' first** for comprehensive diagnostics
2. **Try 's'** if I2C issues suspected
3. **Use 'r'** as last resort for camera reset

### **For Performance:**
1. **Monitor with '?'** during streaming
2. **Check 'd'** for camera configuration
3. **Use 'z'** to reset counters between sessions
