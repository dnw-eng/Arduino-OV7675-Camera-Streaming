## Features

- ✅ **Live video capture** from OV7675 camera
- ✅ **Real-time streaming** via serial port
- ✅ **Continuous streaming mode** (5 FPS)
- ✅ **Single frame capture** on demand
- ✅ **Configurable resolution** (QQVGA 160x120)
- ✅ **RGB565 color format** (16-bit color)
- ✅ **Interactive commands** via serial monitor
- ✅ **Frame counter** and status monitoring
- ✅ **LED indicators** for streaming status

## Dependencies

- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- **Arduino_OV767X_TinyMLx** library (included with Harvard_TinyMLx)
- Wire library (I2C communication)
- Arduino Nano 33 BLE board support

## Setup

1. Connect the hardware as per the pin diagram above
2. Upload the firmware to your Arduino Nano 33 BLE
3. Open serial monitor at 115200 baud
4. Use the interactive commands to control the camera

## Usage

### **Available Commands:**

- **'c'** - Capture and stream one frame
- **'p'** - Start continuous streaming (5 FPS)
- **'x'** - Stop continuous streaming
- **'?'** - Show streaming status and frame count
- **'z'** - Reset frame counter
- **'r'** - Reset camera
- **'d'** - Show camera info
- **'i'** - I2C device scan
- **'s'** - Slow I2C mode + scan
- **'t'** - Test I2C bus functionality

### **Streaming Modes:**

1. **Single Frame Mode:** Use 'c' command to capture individual frames
2. **Continuous Mode:** Use 'p' to start, 'x' to stop automatic streaming
3. **Status Monitoring:** Use '?' to check current state and frame count

### **Expected Output:**

```
=== OV7675 Camera Video Viewer ===
Initializing camera system...
I2C initialized at 100kHz
[I2C scan results]
Initializing OV7675 camera... SUCCESS
Camera initialized: 160x120 @ 5 FPS
Format: 16 bits per pixel

=== Camera Ready for Streaming ===
Commands: [list of available commands]

Starting continuous streaming...
Continuous streaming ENABLED - frames will stream automatically

FRAME_START #1
FRAME_SIZE:38400
FRAME_WIDTH:160
FRAME_HEIGHT:120
FRAME_FORMAT:RGB565
FRAME_DATA:
[Actual camera data in hex format...]
FRAME_END

FRAME_START #2
[Next frame data...]
FRAME_END
```

## Technical Specifications

- **Resolution:** 160x120 (QQVGA)
- **Color Format:** RGB565 (16-bit per pixel)
- **Frame Rate:** 5 FPS (configurable)
- **Frame Size:** 38,400 bytes per frame
- **Data Rate:** ~192 KB/s
- **I2C Address:** 0x21 (automatically detected)

## Troubleshooting

### **If Camera Won't Initialize:**
1. Check all pin connections match the table above
2. Verify 3.3V power supply is stable
3. Use 's' command for slow I2C mode
4. Check that Arduino Nano 33 BLE is selected as board

### **If I2C Scan Shows No Devices:**
- This is normal - the library uses its own I2C implementation
- Camera will still work if initialization succeeds
- Use 's' command for detailed I2C diagnostics

### **If Streaming is Slow:**
- Frame rate is limited by serial port bandwidth
- Consider reducing resolution or frame rate
- Ensure serial monitor is set to 115200 baud

## Performance Notes

- **Memory Usage:** ~38KB per frame buffer
- **Processing:** Real-time frame capture and streaming
- **Latency:** Minimal (200ms between frames at 5 FPS)
- **Reliability:** Proven library with automatic error handling

## Next Steps

The camera system is now fully functional and ready for:
- **Computer vision applications**
- **TinyML projects**
- **Video monitoring systems**
- **Image processing experiments**
- **Integration with other Arduino projects**

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check hardware connections first
2. Verify board selection (Arduino Nano 33 BLE)
3. Use diagnostic commands ('s', 't', '?')
4. Review serial monitor output for specific error messages
