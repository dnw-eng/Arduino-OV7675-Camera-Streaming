# OV7675 Camera Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ **Current Status: FULLY WORKING**

**Good news!** The camera system is now fully operational. This troubleshooting guide has been updated to reflect the current working state and help with any future issues.

## **What's Working Now:**

‚úÖ **Camera Initialization:** Automatic detection and setup  
‚úÖ **Frame Capture:** Single frame capture on demand  
‚úÖ **Continuous Streaming:** 5 FPS automatic streaming  
‚úÖ **Interactive Commands:** Full command set functional  
‚úÖ **Status Monitoring:** Real-time status and frame counting  
‚úÖ **LED Indicators:** Visual feedback during streaming  
‚úÖ **Error Handling:** Robust error detection and recovery  

## **Current Working Commands:**

- **'c'** - Capture and stream one frame
- **'p'** - Start continuous streaming (5 FPS)
- **'x'** - Stop continuous streaming
- **'?'** - Show streaming status and frame count
- **'z'** - Reset frame counter
- **'r'** - Reset camera
- **'d'** - Show camera info
- **'i'** - I2C device scan
- **'s'** - Slow I2C mode + scan
- **'t'** - Test I2C bus functionality

## **Common Questions & Answers**

### **Q: I2C scan shows no devices, but camera works. Is this normal?**
‚úÖ **YES, this is completely normal and expected!**
- The working **Arduino_OV767X_TinyMLx** library uses its own I2C implementation
- Camera functions perfectly even if manual I2C scan fails
- This is not an error condition

### **Q: What's the difference between single frame and continuous mode?**
- **Single Frame ('c'):** Captures one frame when you send the command
- **Continuous ('p'):** Automatically streams frames at 5 FPS until stopped with 'x'
- **LED Indicator:** Blinks rapidly during continuous streaming, off when stopped

### **Q: How do I know if streaming is working?**
- **Visual:** Built-in LED blinks rapidly during streaming
- **Serial:** Frame data appears automatically every 200ms (5 FPS)
- **Status:** Use '?' command to check current state

### **Q: Can I change the frame rate or resolution?**
- **Frame Rate:** Currently set to 5 FPS (configurable in code)
- **Resolution:** Currently QQVGA 160x120 (optimized for memory)
- **Format:** RGB565 (16-bit color)

## **Performance & Optimization**

### **Current Performance:**
- **Frame Rate:** 5 FPS (200ms between frames)
- **Resolution:** 160x120 pixels
- **Data Rate:** ~192 KB/s
- **Memory Usage:** ~38KB per frame
- **Latency:** Minimal (real-time capture)

### **Optimization Tips:**
1. **Serial Monitor:** Set to 115200 baud for best performance
2. **Frame Rate:** 5 FPS is optimal for serial streaming
3. **Resolution:** QQVGA balances quality and performance
4. **Memory:** System automatically manages frame buffers

## **Troubleshooting (If Issues Arise)**

### **Camera Won't Initialize**
‚ùå **Symptoms:** "Camera initialization failed" or similar errors
‚úÖ **Solutions:**
1. **Check hardware connections** (use the verified pin table)
2. **Verify power supply** (stable 3.3V)
3. **Check board selection** (Arduino Nano 33 BLE)
4. **Use 's' command** for slow I2C diagnostics

### **Streaming is Slow or Unreliable**
‚ùå **Symptoms:** Frames arrive slowly or inconsistently
‚úÖ **Solutions:**
1. **Check serial monitor baud rate** (115200)
2. **Reduce frame rate** if needed (modify TARGET_FPS)
3. **Check USB connection** quality
4. **Monitor memory usage** with '?' command

### **Commands Not Responding**
‚ùå **Symptoms:** Serial commands ignored or return errors
‚úÖ **Solutions:**
1. **Check serial monitor** is open and at correct baud rate
2. **Send single characters** (not words or sentences)
3. **Wait for command prompt** before sending commands
4. **Use '?' command** to check system status

### **LED Not Blinking During Streaming**
‚ùå **Symptoms:** LED stays off during continuous streaming
‚úÖ **Solutions:**
1. **Check if streaming is actually active** with '?' command
2. **Verify LED_BUILTIN pin** is not being used by other code
3. **Restart streaming** with 'p' command
4. **Check for compilation warnings** about LED pin

## **Advanced Diagnostics**

### **Using the 's' Command (Slow I2C Mode):**
```
's'
Switching to slow I2C mode (10kHz)...
Rescanning I2C bus...
[Detailed I2C scan results]
```

### **Using the 't' Command (I2C Test):**
```
't'
=== I2C Bus Diagnostic Test ===
Test 1: Basic I2C communication
Test 2: I2C clock speed
Test 3: Pin states
Test 4: I2C speed test
```

### **Using the '?' Command (Status Check):**
```
'?'
Streaming Status:
  Continuous streaming: ENABLED
  Total frames captured: 25
  Frame rate: 5 FPS
  Resolution: 160x120
```

## **Maintenance & Best Practices**

### **Regular Checks:**
1. **Monitor frame count** with '?' command
2. **Check streaming status** regularly
3. **Reset frame counter** with 'z' if needed
4. **Use 'r' command** to reset camera if issues arise

### **Performance Monitoring:**
1. **Watch LED behavior** for streaming status
2. **Monitor serial output** for frame consistency
3. **Check frame numbering** for gaps or duplicates
4. **Verify timing** between frames (should be ~200ms)

### **System Health:**
1. **Camera working:** All commands respond correctly
2. **Streaming stable:** Consistent frame delivery
3. **Memory stable:** No allocation errors
4. **Timing accurate:** Frames arrive at expected intervals

## **Future Enhancements**

The system is now ready for:
- **Computer vision applications**
- **TinyML integration**
- **Video processing algorithms**
- **Real-time monitoring systems**
- **Integration with other projects**
