- **Providing detailed troubleshooting information** for hardware issues
- **Verifying basic I2C functionality** before main project deployment

## üéØ **When to Use This Tool**

- **Before setting up** the main OV7675 Video Viewer
- **When troubleshooting** I2C communication issues
- **To verify hardware connections** are correct
- **For educational purposes** learning about I2C communication

## üìä **Expected Output**

### **Successful I2C Detection:**
```
=== OV7675 I2C Test ===
I2C initialized at 100kHz
Testing I2C communication...

Scanning I2C bus...
Device found at 0x21 (OV7675 camera - EXPECTED!)
Device found at 0x6A (IMU LSM9DS1)
Device found at 0x5C (Barometric sensor)
Scan complete. Found 3 device(s).
I2C bus is working!

Testing OV7675 addresses specifically:
  0x42: No response (error 1)
  0x21: RESPONDING ‚úì
  0x30: No response (error 1)
  0x60: No response (error 1)
  0x61: No response (error 1)
```

### **No Devices Found:**
```
No I2C devices found! Troubleshooting:
  1. Check SDA connection: Camera Pin 4 ‚Üí Arduino A4
  2. Check SCL connection: Camera Pin 3 ‚Üí Arduino A5
  3. Check 3.3V power: Camera Pin 1 ‚Üí Arduino 3.3V
  4. Check ground: Camera Pin 2 ‚Üí Arduino GND
  5. Verify camera module pins (Pin 1 = VCC)
  6. Try different I2C speed
